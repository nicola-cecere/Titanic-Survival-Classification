This repository contains the code and documentation for the Titanic Survival Prediction project, which is part of the Data Mining and Time Series course at Universidad Politécnica de Madrid.

## Overview

In this project, we apply the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) process to the famous Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to predict who will survive the Titanic disaster based on various features such as passenger class, age, gender, and more.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project can be found on Kaggle: [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).

## Data Mining Process

It followed the standard KDD process, which includes the following steps:

1. **Data Collection:** We gathered the Titanic dataset from Kaggle.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** We cleaned and prepared the data for analysis, handling missing values and outliers.
3. **Feature Engineering:** We created relevant features and transformed the data for better model performance.
4. **Model Building:** We trained and evaluated several machine learning models.
5. **Model Evaluation:** We assessed model performance using appropriate metrics.
6. **Model Deployment:** We deployed the best-performing model for predicting Titanic survival.
